Summary
I'm a Computer Science undergraduate pursuing a certificate in
Quantum Computing and Quantum Information, with two years of
technical experience and a growing interest in the intersection of
computing and physics.
I've worked with Java, Python, C, C++, and C#, building projects
involving data structures, algorithms, mobile apps, and game
development. As I prepare for further education through graduate
studies, I aspire to continue to build my foundation through
coursework, research, and hands-on exploration in Quantum
Computing.
I'm eager to contribute to innovative, interdisciplinary work—whether
in research labs, graduate programs, or teams advancing quantum
technologies.
